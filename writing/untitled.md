**Currently working on a side project on building a Hospital bed management system (website) with a friend of mine**. The idea is to make it easier to find empty beds to admit patients especially those in critical condition by accessing a web platform that keeps a track record of the status (condition) of all beds in the hospital. **This will help reduce the time taken to find beds and as well as save the life of the patient by helping them get quick attention.**
